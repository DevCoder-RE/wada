## 1. Certification API Failure Mitigation

### 1.1 Fallback Strategies

#### Primary Fallback: Local Cache with Offline Verification

- **Strategy:** Maintain a local cache of verified supplement data for offline verification
- **Implementation:**
  - Cache verified supplement data in IndexedDB (web) and SQLite (mobile)
  - Implement cache expiration policies (24-48 hours for certification data)
  - Provide "Offline Mode" indicator to users when API unavailable
- **Coverage:** 80% of commonly scanned supplements covered in cache
- **User Experience:** Seamless scanning experience with "Last verified: X hours ago" messaging

#### Secondary Fallback: Manual Entry Mode

- **Strategy:** Allow manual entry of supplement information when scanning fails
- **Implementation:**
  - Pre-populated database of common supplements with certification status
  - User-guided form for entering supplement details
  - Automatic submission to certification APIs when connection restored
- **Coverage:** 95% of supplement types supported through manual database

#### Tertiary Fallback: Community Verification

- **Strategy:** Implement peer verification system for uncertified supplements
- **Implementation:**
  - User flagging system for suspicious products
  - Community voting on supplement safety
  - Expert moderator review process
- **Coverage:** Emergency fallback for completely unknown products

### 1.2 API Failure Detection and Recovery

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

- **Implementation:** Implement circuit breaker for each certification API
- **Thresholds:**
  - Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
  - Half-open after 30 seconds
  - Close after 3 successful calls
- **User Impact:** Automatic fallback to cached data during outages

#### Graceful Degradation

- **Strategy:** Continue core functionality with reduced features during API outages
- **Features Maintained:** Logbook access, educational content, profile management
- **Features Degraded:** Real-time verification (falls back to cached/offline mode)

## 2. Integration Points Monitoring and Alerting

### 2.1 Certification API Monitoring

#### Real-time Health Checks

- **Implementation:** Dedicated health check endpoints for each certification partner
- **Frequency:** Every 30 seconds for primary APIs, every 5 minutes for secondary
- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Response time (target: <2 seconds)
  - Success rate (target: >99.5%)
  - Error rate by error type
  - Rate limiting status

#### Alerting System

- **Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):**
  - API down for >5 minutes
  - Error rate >10% in 5-minute window
  - Rate limit exceeded
- **Warning Alerts (Investigation Required):**
  - Response time >5 seconds
  - Error rate >2% in 15-minute window
- **Info Alerts (Monitoring):**
  - API performance degradation
  - Unusual traffic patterns

### 2.2 Database Integration Monitoring

#### Supabase Health Monitoring

- **Connection Pool Monitoring:** Track active connections vs. pool size
- **Query Performance:** Monitor slow queries (>500ms)
- **Storage Usage:** Alert when approaching storage limits (80%, 90%, 95%)
- **RLS Policy Violations:** Track and alert on security policy failures

#### Cross-Platform Sync Monitoring

- **Sync Success Rate:** Target >99.9% successful syncs
- **Conflict Resolution:** Track merge conflicts and resolution success
- **Data Consistency:** Periodic checks for data integrity across platforms

### 2.3 Third-Party Service Monitoring

#### External Dependencies

- **Vercel Functions:** Monitor cold start times, execution duration, error rates
- **Supabase Edge Functions:** Track performance and reliability
- **CDN Performance:** Monitor asset delivery times and cache hit rates

### 2.4 Alerting Infrastructure

#### Alert Channels

- **Critical:** SMS/PagerDuty for immediate response
- **Warning:** Slack notifications to development team
- **Info:** Email digests and dashboard updates

#### Alert Escalation

- **Level 1 (Auto-resolve):** Minor performance issues
- **Level 2 (Team Response):** Service degradation affecting <10% users
- **Level 3 (Immediate Response):** Service outage affecting >10% users

## 3. Rollback Procedures
