# Project Brief: Apex Performance (MVP)

### **Purpose**
To validate the core value proposition of the Apex Performance platform by launching a focused, athlete-centric Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP will empower individual athletes to make informed choices about supplements and medications, ensuring safety and compliance. Based on competitive analysis, the MVP will differentiate through certification partnerships and athlete-specific safety focus while addressing key threats from established fitness platforms.

**OKRs / Success Metrics for MVP:**
*   **Acquisition:** Achieve 10,000 registered Freemium users within 6 months of public launch (updated to account for dual-platform presence).
*   **Monetization:** Convert 2% of Freemium users to Premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) by Month 9.
*   **Engagement:** Achieve a 40% retention rate (users performing at least one scan) 30 days after account creation.
*   **Validation:** Secure 1,000 positive App Store/Play Store reviews (avg. >4.5 stars) within the first year.
*   **Competitive Differentiation:** Establish certification partnerships with NSF, Informed Sport, and Global DRO within 3 months.

### **Stakeholders**
- **Primary (for MVP):** Individual Athletes (Elite amateur, collegiate, and high school).
- **Secondary (Future Phases):** Parents, Coaches, Personal Trainers, Physical Therapists, Sports Associations.

### **MVP Feature Set**
The V1 of Apex Performance will be a dual-platform application consisting of a web-first PWA and a native mobile app (Flutter) sharing the same APIs. This expanded scope addresses competitive threats by ensuring broad accessibility and app store visibility. The MVP will provide three core functions for the individual athlete:
1.  **Scan & Verify:** Barcode scanner for instant verification of supplements and medications against certification databases (NSF, Informed Sport) and the Global DRO API.
2.  **Log & Track:** A secure, personal logbook to track supplement and medication history. Account creation is required to access this feature.
3.  **Learn & Buy Safely:** Access to essential educational content and affiliate links to purchase certified products from trusted retailers.

**Platform Implementation:**
- **Web App:** PWA for cross-platform web access
- **Mobile App:** Flutter-based native app for iOS and Android, utilizing shared API backend
- **Shared Backend:** Common API infrastructure for data consistency across platforms

### **Eliminated from MVP**
To ensure a focused launch, the following features and personas are explicitly **excluded** from the V1 release:
-   All features for Coaches, Parents, Trainers, and Therapists (e.g., Dashboards, Portals).
-   Community forums or social features.
-   Advanced gamified elements like streaks or badges (basic progress indicators may be included).
-   Multi-language support beyond English (initial focus on primary markets).

**Note:** Manual entry for supplements/medications has been moved to V1.1 roadmap to address competitive vulnerabilities in user acquisition.

### **Constraints**
- **Budget:** To be determined by seed funding round (Target: $600k-$700k for MVP phase, increased for dual-platform development).
- **Hard deadline:** N/A (Market-driven launch).
- **Regulatory:** Must maintain HIPAA/GDPR compliance for user data; requires formal API agreements with Global DRO, NSF, and Informed Sport; must implement robust legal disclaimers.
- **Platform:** Dual-platform implementation - Web-first PWA and Flutter-based native mobile apps for iOS/Android, sharing common API backend.
- **Competitive:** Must establish certification partnerships within 3 months to maintain differentiation advantage.

### **Competitive Positioning**
Based on recent competitor analysis:
- **Primary Differentiation:** Certification verification partnerships (NSF, Informed Sport, Global DRO) and athlete-specific safety focus.
- **Key Threats:** MyFitnessPal's user base and potential feature expansion; emerging niche apps with similar verification features.
- **Strategic Advantages:** Blue ocean opportunity in athlete safety; partnership ecosystem with sports associations.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Dual-platform presence for broader accessibility; transparent affiliate model to build trust.

### **MVP Roadmap**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Core development - Web PWA with barcode scanning, logbook, and educational content.
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Mobile app development (Flutter) and API integration.
- **Phase 3 (Months 4-5):** Certification partnerships, affiliate program setup, beta testing.
- **Phase 4 (Months 5-6):** Public launch, user acquisition campaigns, initial monitoring.
- **V1.1 (Months 7-9):** Manual entry feature, improved mobile UX, expanded educational content.
