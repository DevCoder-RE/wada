# Project Iterations Log

This document captures key changes and iterations in the direction of the Apex Performance project. Each entry includes the date/time, context, and summary of changes.

## Iteration 1: MVP Scope Expansion and Competitive Positioning Update
**Date/Time:** September 7, 2025, 17:55 UTC  
**Context:** Following completion of comprehensive competitor analysis (conducted via interactive session with Business Analyst), key insights revealed the need to strengthen competitive differentiation and address platform accessibility concerns. The analysis identified MyFitnessPal as primary threat and emphasized the importance of certification partnerships and dual-platform presence to counter competitive vulnerabilities in user acquisition and app store visibility.

**Summary of Changes:**
- **MVP Scope Expansion:** Updated from web-first PWA only to dual-platform implementation including Flutter-based native mobile app for iOS/Android, sharing common APIs with the web app. This addresses competitive threats by ensuring broader accessibility and app store discoverability.
- **Competitive Positioning:** Added new section highlighting differentiation through certification partnerships (NSF, Informed Sport, Global DRO) and athlete-specific safety focus. Identified key threats from established fitness platforms and blue ocean opportunities in athlete safety.
- **OKRs Update:** Added new OKR for establishing certification partnerships within 3 months. Updated acquisition OKR to account for dual-platform presence.
- **Budget Adjustment:** Increased target budget from $500k to $600k-$700k to accommodate Flutter mobile development and expanded scope.
- **Feature Adjustments:** Moved manual entry for supplements/medications to V1.1 roadmap to address user acquisition friction identified in competitive analysis.
- **MVP Roadmap Addition:** Created 4-phase development plan with clear milestones for web PWA, mobile app, partnerships, and post-launch features.
- **Constraints Update:** Modified platform constraints to specify dual-platform implementation and added competitive constraints for partnership timelines.

**Impact:** These changes strengthen the project's competitive position by addressing key vulnerabilities while expanding market reach through dual-platform presence. The updated scope maintains focus on core value proposition while mitigating identified risks from competitor analysis.

## Iteration 2: Fullstack Architecture Completion and Development Readiness
**Date/Time:** September 7, 2025, 18:30 UTC  
**Context:** Following the MVP scope expansion to dual-platform implementation, the comprehensive fullstack architecture document has been completed to provide technical foundation for development. This builds on the competitive analysis insights and ensures the architecture supports both web PWA and Flutter mobile platforms with shared APIs.

**Summary of Changes:**
- **Architecture Document Completion:** Expanded the placeholder architecture file into a comprehensive 12-section document covering system design, technology stack, API patterns, security, deployment, monitoring, testing, and coding standards.
- **Technology Stack Finalization:** Confirmed React + TypeScript for web PWA, Flutter for mobile, Supabase for backend services, and Vercel for deployment infrastructure.
- **Dual-Platform Design:** Established shared API architecture allowing both platforms to leverage common backend services while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.
- **Security and Scalability:** Incorporated security best practices, error handling strategies, and scalability plans to support athlete safety focus and future growth.
- **Development Readiness:** Document includes detailed implementation guidance, key architectural decisions, and rationale to enable efficient development team execution.

**Impact:** The completed architecture provides a solid technical foundation for the dual-platform MVP, enabling immediate transition to development phase. This ensures consistent implementation across platforms while maintaining focus on core features like barcode scanning, supplement tracking, and educational content.
