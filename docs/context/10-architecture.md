## 4. API Design and Communication Patterns

### RESTful API Design
- RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- Versioned APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- Consistent error response format

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/data/records` - Fetch BMAD records
- `POST /api/data/records` - Create new record
- `PUT /api/data/records/:id` - Update record
- `DELETE /api/data/records/:id` - Delete record

### Communication Patterns
- **Client to API**: HTTP/HTTPS with JWT authentication
- **API to Database**: Direct SQL queries via Supabase client
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections via Supabase Realtime
- **File Uploads**: Multipart form data to Supabase Storage

### API Security

## Key Architectural Decisions and Rationale

1. **Dual-Platform with Shared APIs**: Allows code reuse and consistent functionality across web and mobile while leveraging platform-specific strengths.

2. **Vercel + Supabase**: Serverless architecture reduces operational overhead, auto-scaling handles traffic spikes, and managed services accelerate development.

3. **Supabase for Backend**: Provides authentication, database, and real-time features out-of-the-box, reducing custom backend development time.

4. **PWA for Web**: Enables offline functionality and app-like experience without app store dependencies.

5. **RESTful APIs**: Simple, widely understood pattern that works well with HTTP and is easy to consume from both React and Flutter.

6. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication that works seamlessly with serverless functions and mobile apps.

7. **PostgreSQL**: Robust, ACID-compliant database suitable for complex queries and data integrity requirements in BMAD context.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the WADA BMAD project, balancing development speed, maintainability, and scalability while meeting the requirements of a dual-platform application.
