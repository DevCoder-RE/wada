# S4-Data-Storage: Secure Logbook Implementation

## Overview

Implement secure logbook functionality for storing and tracking supplement data with proper authentication, verification integration, and data security measures.

## Subtasks

### Security & Authentication

- [x] **S4.1.1**: Implement secure user session validation for logbook access
- [x] **S4.1.2**: Add role-based access control (athlete/coach/admin) for logbook operations
- [x] **S4.1.3**: Implement data encryption for sensitive logbook entries
- [x] **S4.1.4**: Add audit logging for all logbook modifications

### Verification Integration

- [x] **S4.2.1**: Integrate certification verification with logbook entry creation
- [x] **S4.2.2**: Add verification status tracking and display in logbook
- [x] **S4.2.3**: Implement automatic verification on barcode scan integration
- [x] **S4.2.4**: Add verification expiry monitoring and alerts

### Data Storage & Management

- [x] **S4.3.1**: Implement secure supplement data storage with validation
- [x] **S4.3.2**: Add data backup and recovery mechanisms
- [x] **S4.3.3**: Implement data retention policies for logbook entries
- [x] **S4.3.4**: Add data export functionality with compliance checks

### User Interface Enhancements

- [x] **S4.4.1**: Enhance logbook UI with verification status indicators
- [x] **S4.4.2**: Add secure entry editing with audit trail
- [x] **S4.4.3**: Implement compliance dashboard with real-time updates
- [x] **S4.4.4**: Add offline data synchronization capabilities

### Testing & Validation

- [x] **S4.5.1**: Write comprehensive unit tests for secure logbook operations
- [x] **S4.5.2**: Implement integration tests for auth and scanner systems
- [x] **S4.5.3**: Add security testing for data protection measures
- [x] **S4.5.4**: Validate compliance with data protection regulations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security Requirements

- All logbook data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- User authentication required for all logbook operations
- Role-based permissions must be enforced
- Audit logs must track all data modifications

### Functional Requirements

- Seamless integration with barcode scanner for verified entries
- Real-time verification status updates
- Offline capability with secure local storage
- Compliance reporting and monitoring

### Performance Requirements

- Logbook operations must complete within 2 seconds
- Support for 1000+ entries per athlete
- Efficient caching for verification data
- Minimal impact on mobile battery life

## Integration Points

### Authentication System

- Uses existing `AuthService.getCurrentUser()` for session validation
- Integrates with role-based permissions from user profiles
- Supports secure token-based authentication

### Scanner System

- Leverages `CertificationService.verifyBarcodeWithCertifications()` for verification
- Integrates with existing barcode scanning UI components
- Supports offline verification using cached data

### Database System

- Uses existing Supabase integration for secure data storage
- Implements Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Supports real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
