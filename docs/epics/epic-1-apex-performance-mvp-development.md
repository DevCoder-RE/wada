# Epic 1: Apex Performance MVP Development

**Epic Goal:** Deliver a fully functional dual-platform MVP that enables athletes to safely verify and track supplements/medications.

**Integration Requirements:** Seamless data synchronization between web PWA and mobile app, consistent user experience across platforms.

**Stories:**

- Story 1.1: Implement Core Authentication System
- Story 1.2: Develop Barcode Scanning Feature
- Story 1.3: Build Personal Logbook System
- Story 1.4: Create Educational Content Platform
- Story 1.5: Implement Cross-Platform Synchronization
- Story 1.6: Establish Certification Partnerships
- Story 1.7: Launch Beta Testing and User Acquisition

**Dependencies and Sequencing:**

1. Story 1.6 (Partnerships) must be completed before Story 1.2 (Scanning) can start.
2. Story 1.1 (Auth) is prerequisite for Stories 1.3, 1.5.
3. Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 can be developed in parallel after auth.
4. Story 1.5 (Sync) depends on completion of 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.
5. Story 1.7 (Beta) depends on all previous stories.

**Dual-Platform Considerations:**

- All stories must implement features for both web PWA and Flutter mobile app.
- Shared backend via Supabase ensures consistency.
- Testing required on both platforms for each story.
